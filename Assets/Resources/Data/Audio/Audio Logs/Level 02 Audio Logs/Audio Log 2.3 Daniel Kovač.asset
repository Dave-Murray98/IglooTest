  - timestamp: 6.4
    text: Eighteen targets neutralised. Sonic deterrents proved effective - subjects
      became disoriented, easy to eliminate. No personnel injuries.
  - timestamp: 15.8
    text: Some were carrying eggs. We destroyed them as well - can't risk them hatching
      near operational areas.

    text: This should keep the perimeter clear for another six to eight weeks. I'll
      schedule the next sweep accordingly. Good work team.
