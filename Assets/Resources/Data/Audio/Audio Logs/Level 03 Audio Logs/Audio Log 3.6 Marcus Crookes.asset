    text: Final operational brief. Day 20, 2200 hours.
  - timestamp: 4
    text: We have everything. Saskia's documentation, the falsified survey, five
      years of environmental data, worker testimonies, financial records... the fucking
      lot.
  - timestamp: 16
    text: The upload will go to news outlets, the Colonial Office, public archives
      - all simultaneously. TDI cannot possibly suppress all of them.
  - timestamp: 26
    text: If security finds us before the upload completes, we hold position. We
      knew this might happen. We came prepared.
  - timestamp: 36
    text: This evidence gets out. Whatever the cost. These people destroyed an ecosystem
      and murdered a whistleblower. The truth matters more than any of us.
  - timestamp: 50
    text: Final checks. We move in two hours.
