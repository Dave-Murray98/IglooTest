    text: Environmental log, Dr Chen, week nineteen.
  - timestamp: 5.5
    text: The water chemistry readings are... they're wrong.
  - timestamp: 9.5
    text: 'The baseline pH should be around 4.5 according to the planetary survey. '
  - timestamp: 14
    text: But I'm getting readings of 6.8, 7.2 in some areas. That's nearly neutral.
  - timestamp: 19.9
    text: I've recalibrated the equipment twice. The readings are accurate.
  - timestamp: 24
    text: The native species are adapted for acidic conditions. If the water's becoming
      less acidic, if it continues... this could destabilise the entire ecosystem.
  - timestamp: 35.5
    text: I need to speak with Henderson about this. Find out if operations might
      be affecting the water chemistry somehow.
