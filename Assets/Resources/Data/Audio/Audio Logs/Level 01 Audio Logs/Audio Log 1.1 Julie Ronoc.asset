    text: Personal log, Julie Ronoc.
  - timestamp: 2.4
    text: Just hit six months at Ben-7 today. Mum keeps asking when I'm coming back
      Earth-side, but the pay's too good to leave. Already cleared half my academy
      debt.
  - timestamp: 16.7
    text: Weather's always the same down here - dark and wet. Miss the sunlight sometimes,
      but the work's not bad. Bit repetitive, decent crew though.
  - timestamp: 28.5
    text: Contract's up in eighteen months. Might extend. Another year here and I
      could actually afford my own hab unit.
  - timestamp: 37
    text: Anyway. Back to it.
